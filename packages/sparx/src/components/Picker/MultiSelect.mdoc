# MultiSelect

`MultiSelect` is a choice-selection input that allows users to choose multiple options out of a
list.

The interface is identical to `Select` and `Combobox`, except `selectedItem` becomes
`selectedItems`, an array of items, and `onSelect` receives the full array of selected items rather
than just a single item.
