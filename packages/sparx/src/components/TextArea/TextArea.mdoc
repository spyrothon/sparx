# TextArea

For textual input that is longer than just a few words, `TextArea` provides a larger, multi-line,
resizable input area for users to write out content of any length.

{% showcase %}

```
<TextArea
  label="Large Text Input"
  placeholder="Enter a paragraph"
  description="Users can enter lots of text in these."
/>
```

{% /showcase %}

By default, `TextArea` will render 5 rows of text before scrolling, and the user can resize the
input vertically. Both of these can be overridden with the `rows` and `resize` props.

`TextArea` also accepts a `maxLength` prop to show a progressive visual indication for a maximum
input length as the user's types.

{% showcase %}

```
<TextArea maxLength={100} />
```

{% /showcase %}
