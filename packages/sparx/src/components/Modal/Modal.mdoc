# ConfirmModal

`ConfirmModal` provides a simple, consistent way of getting user confirmation for an action. All
that's required is a `title` and an `onConfirm` action, plus optional `body` text, an `onCancel`
action, and color control.

To make sure that the user has to hit one of "Confirm" or "Cancel", pass the additional
`closeOnBackdrop` option to `openModal`.
