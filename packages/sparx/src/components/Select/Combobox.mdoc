# Combobox

{% callout type="info" %}
`Combobox` does not currently support multiple selections nor combobox
(options + search) functionality, but these will be added in the future.
{% /callout %}

`Combobox` is a choice-selection input that lets users choose options out of a list.

{% showcase-file example="combobox" /%}

`Combobox` is good for medium to large lists of options. In certain cases with a very limited
number of options, a `RadioGroup` may provide a better experience for the user.
